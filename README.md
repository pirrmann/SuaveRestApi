This is a starter project to use in an F# coding exercise working with a REST API built on top of Suave.

It embeds FAKE, Paket, Suave and FSharp.Data. It's a step-by-step exercise based on @tamizhvendan's blogs and Github repository (https://github.com/tamizhvendan/blog-samples/tree/master/SuaveRestApi)

Just clone the repo or download it, and get started coding and testing in F#!

To get started, just run build.cmd or ./build.sh in the folder.
